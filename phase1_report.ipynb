    "The price of diamonds has fluctuated a great deal over the years. In the early 1900s, the price of diamonds was quite low. This was due to a number of factors, including the fact that there was a large supply of diamonds and not a lot of demand. However, over the course of the 20th century, the price of diamonds slowly but steadily increased. Currently, gemstones like diamond are always in demand because of their value in the investment market. For this reason, a model that can accurately predict a house's selling price in Melbourne would have many real-world uses. For instance, real estate agents can provide better service to their customers using this predictive model. Likewise, banks lending out money to home buyers can better estimate the financial aspects of this home loan. Perhaps more importantly as potential home buyers, we as individuals can better figure out if we are being ripped off or we are getting a good deal provided that our predictive model is a reliable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the main objective of this project is two-fold: (1) predict the price of a house sold in Melbourne based on publicly available features of the house, and (2) which features seem to be the best predictors of the house sale price. A secondary objective is to perform some exploratory data analysis by basic descriptive statistics & data visualisation plots to gain some insight into the patterns and relationships existing in the data subsequent to some data cleaning & preprocessing, which is the subject of this Phase 1 report.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we make the important assumption that rows in our dataset are not correlated. That is, we assume that house price observations are independent of one another in this dataset. Of course, this is not a very realistic assumption, however, this assumption allows us to circumvent time series aspects of the underlying dynamics of house prices and also to resort to rather classical predictive models such as multiple linear regression."
